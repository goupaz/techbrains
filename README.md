# Techbrains - "The moment silence is not gold …"

"Good intentions never work, you need good mechanisms to make anything happen." - Jeff Bezos


- [About Us](#aboutus)
- [Contact](#Contact)

## Motivation
- Onboard Open Source community spirit
- Good Leaders talk about it
- People need your expertise, motivation, love

There are some problems, all of us can keep talking, complaining which involves changing mindsets. As example, getting away from sugar, or being vegetarian, or changing community culture. But, sometimes we can partially suceed if right approach taken.

## Use Cases

### UC01 - Delicious food & Successful career 

#### Requirements
- Knowledge & experience = ingredients
- The money spend on ingredients = health variables(late sleep, long work hours etc.), time and cost(spend on trainings, commute etc.)

#### Conclusion
- Right receipt makes food delicious! 
  - Which ingredient in which quality = X technology in junior level
  - Which ingredient what time = X coding language, after Y one
  - Which ingredient how much = 2 years in X company
  
### UC02 - Tribal Leadership
There are 5 stages of community mindset:
- All life sucks
- My life sucks
- I am great, others suck
- We are great as community, others suck
- Life is great!

The success of community is measured, not based on individual level, but rather the majority of it in which stage.

## Agenda
Engineers love build stuff, solve problems!

So let’s build, fix it:

- Egoless, collaborative, competent,  decentralized, scalable, fun community culture
- Structured and indexed data flow within community

## NOT IN Agenda
- Politics
- Religion
- Immigration

## Timeline

All participants have 5mins and 1 slide to talk. Time keeping should be in place, make sure todo homework not exceed allocated time budget.

So, its up to participant creativity, some thoughts:

1. Who you are, what are things you care and interest
2. How can community help you, move faster in ladder
3. Any how, you would like give back to community (referral, guidance etc.)
